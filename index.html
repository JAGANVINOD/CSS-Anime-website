                CSS animations make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two components:
                a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that indicate the start and end states of the animation's style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints. <br>
                If the mismatch in the number of animations and animation property values is inverted, say there are five animation-duration values for three animation-name values, 
                then the extra or unused animation property values, in this case, two animation-duration values, don't apply to any animation and are ignored.
                Building websites requires HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To build websites and applications people want to use, which attract and retain users, you need to create a good user experience. Part of good user experience is ensuring the content is quick to load and responsive to user interaction.
                 This is known as web performance, and in this module you'll focus on the fundamentals of how to create performant websites.

                    The CSS animation longhand properties can accept multiple values, separated by commas. This feature can be used when you want to apply multiple animations in a single rule and set different durations, iteration counts, etc.,
                     for each of the animations. Let's look at some quick examples to explain the different permutations.

            <div>The CSS Media Query gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser and device environment matches rules that you specify. Media queries are a key part of responsive web design because they allow you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport. In this lesson, you will learn about the syntax used in media queries then use them in an interactive example showing how a simple design might be made responsive.Understand that web fonts allow developers to go beyond the web safe font set and use custom fonts on their web apps.</div>
            <div>Fonts generally aren't free to use without restrictions. You have to pay for them and/or follow other license conditions, such as crediting the font creator in your code (or on your site). You shouldn't steal fonts and use them without giving proper credit.
                All major browsers support WOFF/WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format versions 1 and 2). Even older browsers such as IE9 (released in 2011) support the WOFF format.
                WOFF2 supports the entirety of the TrueType and OpenType specifications, including variable fonts, chromatic fonts, and font collections..</div>
            <div>The order in which you list font files is important. If you provide the browser with a list of multiple font files to download, the browser will choose the first font file it's able to use. That's why the format you list first should be the preferred format — that is, WOFF2 — with the older formats listed after that. Browsers that don't understand one format will then fall back to the next format in the list.
                If you need to work with legacy browsers, you should provide EOT (Embedded Open Type), TTF (TrueType Font), and SVG web fonts for download.</div>
